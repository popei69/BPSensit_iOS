# BPSensit_iOS
An iOS prototype app to get access to Sens'it api data designed in Swift language.

Based on https://api.sensit.io/v2/ documentation, I tried to make the OAUTH2 worked, but as I didn't make it work, this app is based on a local JSON file into the app to let be able to design the app.

If you want to give a shot, you'll find all needed in SensitWebManager file and replace the clientID and clientSecret.

You can find more information on this project on my blog post http://benoitpasquier.fr/sensit-ios-swift/
